## 🧏‍♀️ SignBridge — Indian Sign Language Smart Communication System

SignBridge is a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text communication system that converts static and dynamic hand gestures into readable sentences, with live translation support, using Computer Vision + Machine Learning.

---

## 🎯 Project Features

* ✅ Works as a single-click executable (SignBridge.exe)
* 🖐️ Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
* 🔤 Static ISL alphabet recognition (A–Z)
* 🎥 Dynamic word recognition (e.g. Hello, Thank You)
* 🧠 Intelligent motion-based switching between static & dynamic signs
* 📝 Automatic sentence building with spacing logic
* 🌐 Live translation (English ↔ Hindi)
* 🖥️ Web-based UI served locally via Flask
* 🔄 Real-time frontend updates using Socket.IO
* ⚡ Optimized for performance & deployment (PyInstaller-ready)

---

🧠 How the System Works (Core Logic)

**Motion-Based Intelligence**
    Low motion (stable hand) → Static sign detection (letters)
    Continuous motion → Dynamic sign detection (words)
    Prevents repeated predictions using locking & cooldown logic
**Smart Sentence Builder**
    Automatically adds letters and words
    Inserts spaces intelligently
    Supports clearing & backspacing
    Refines output into readable sentences

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Core Technologies**
* Python
* OpenCV
* MediaPipe
* NumPy, Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow / Keras (for dynamic signs)
* gTTS (Online Text-to-Speech)
* ONNX Runtime
  
**Backend**
* Flask
* Flask-SocketIO (threading mode)

**Frontend**
* HTML / CSS / JavaScript
* WebSockets for live updates

**Deployment**
* PyInstaller
* Git LFS (for large .exe & model files)

## ✋ Static Sign Recognition (A–Z)

### Dataset

* Each alphabet (A–Z) has its own folder
* Data stored as `data.csv`
* Each row contains **126 features** (21 landmarks × 3 × 2 hands)

### Training

* All CSV files are merged
* Labels assigned per alphabet
* Model trained using Scikit-learn
* Saved as:

  ```
  isl_alphabet_model.pkl
  ```

## 🎥 Dynamic Sign Recognition (Hello & Thank You)

### Dataset Creation

* Short videos recorded for each word
* MediaPipe extracts landmarks **per frame**
* Each frame → 126 features
* Frames combined into fixed-length sequences
* Saved as `.npy` files

Example shape:

```
(sequence_length, 126)
```

### Training

* `.npy` sequences loaded
* Labels assigned (hello / thank_you)
* Sequence-based model (LSTM)
* Saved as:

  ```
  dynamic_sign_model.h5
  dynamic_sign_model.pkl
  ```

## 🔄 Real-Time Logic

* **Low motion** → Static model (letters)
* **High motion** → Dynamic model (words)
* Static letters form sentences
* Dynamic words are displayed/spoken directly

---

## 🔊 Text-to-Speech

* Uses **online Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**
* Press **S** to speak the sentence
* Temporary audio files auto-deleted
